I did the data exploration and cleaning of the data as part of the pre-processing. We also applied PCA to get the most feasible features for our models.

I ran Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree algorithms on our Bank Customer Churn dataset and predicted values for a test dataset for all. After analyzing and comparing the above accuracy measure results, we can say that the Decision Tree algorithm gives the best result as compared to other models on our dataset. 

1. KNN model gives 83.14% accurate prediction.
2. Naive Bayes model gives 58.16% accurate prediction.
3. Logistic Regression gives 86.32% accurate prediction.
4. Decision Tree gives 91.21% accurate prediction.
5. Random Forest classifier gives 89.98% accurate prediction.
